The city of Spring View is taking bids from six bus companies on the eight routes that must be driven in the surrounding school district. Each company enters a bid of how much it will charge to drive selected routes, although not all companies bid on all routes. The data are listed in Table. (If a company does not bid on a route, the corresponding entry is blank.) The city must decide which companies to assign to which routes with the specifications that: if a company does not bid on a route, it cannot be assigned to that route exactly one company must be assigned to each route a company can be assigned to at most two routes. The objective is to minimize the total cost of covering all routes.
