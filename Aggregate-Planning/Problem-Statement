During the next four months the Sure Step Company must meet (on time) the following demands for pairs of shoes: 
 
3000 in month 1; 5000 in month 2; 2000 month 3; and 1000 in month 4. 
 
At the beginning of month 1, 500 pairs of shoes are on hand, and Sure Step has 100 workers. A worker is paid 
$1500 per month. Each worker can work up to 160 hours per month before he or she receives overtime. A worker 
can work up to 20 hours of overtime per month and is paid $13 per hour for overtime labor. 
 
It takes four hours of labor and $15 of raw material to produce a pair of shoes. At the beginning of each 
month, workers can be hired or fired. Each hired worker costs $1600, and each fired worker costs $2000. 
At the end of each month, a holding cost of $3 per pair of shoes left in inventory is incurred. Production 
in a given month can be used to meet that month's demand. Sure Step wants to use LP to determine its optimum 
production schedule and labor policy (i.e., how many employees to hire / fire) at the minimum cost.

Before you click on the Model Structure, contemplate for few minutes how you would possibly set up a spreadsheet 
model to describe Sure Step's business environment. After deeper thinking, you will begin to see a picture how 
everything is related. If you start drawing a "logic" picture you will see even a clearer model emerge in your mind.
