Logistics Models are similar to Transportation Models except for:
1.  Arcs have capacities
2. In Flows and Out Flows can be associated with any node (we have two-way traffic)

We have three types of Nodes:
1: Origins - this is where supply begins (they have Capcities)
2: Destinations -this is the opposite of Origins (they have demands)
3: Trans-shipment Terminals or Warehouses (This is where goods simply pass through)

The best way to analyz these types of problems is in terms of Net Inflows and Net Out FLows
Net Inflow (of any node) = Total Inflow - Total Out Flow
Net Out Flow = Total Out Flow - Total In Flow
Origins have positive Out Flows. This means Net Out Flows < = Capacity
Destinations have positive In Flows. This means Net Inflows > = Demand
Trans-shipment Terminals (warehouses) have Net Inflow - Net Out Flow = Zero
