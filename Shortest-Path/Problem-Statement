Maude Jenkins, a 90-year-old woman, is planning to walk across the state, west to east, to gain support for a political cause she favors. She wants to travel the shortÂ­est distance to get from city 1 to city 10, using the roads shown in Figure below. The numbers on the roads are miles. Roads with double-headed arrows indicate that travel is possible in both directions (of course with the same distance in both directions). What route should Maude take?
