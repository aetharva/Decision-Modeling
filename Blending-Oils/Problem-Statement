Chandler Oil Refinery has 5000 barrels of crude oil 1 and 10,000 barrels of crude oil 2 available. 
Chandler sells gasoline and heating oil. These products are produced by blending the two crude oils 
together. 

Each barrel of crude oil 1 has a quality level of 10 and each barrel of crude oil 2 has a quality level 
of 5. Gasoline must have an average quality level of at least 8, whereas heating oil must have an average 
quality level of at least 6.  Note: Quality is calculated as a function of Octane rating, viscosity, and flashpoint.

Gasoline sells for $75 per barrel, and heating oil sells for $60 per barrel. In addition, if any barrels 
of the crude oil are leftover, they can be sold for $65 (Oil type 1) and $50 (Oil type 2) per barrel, respectively.  

Assume that demand for heating oil and gasoline is unlimited, so all of Chandlerâ€™s production will be sold.
Chandler wants to maximize its revenue from selling gasoline, heating oil, and any kind of leftover crude oils.
