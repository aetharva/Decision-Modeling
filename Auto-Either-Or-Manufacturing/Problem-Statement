Dorien Auto is considering manufacturing three types of cars (compact, midsize, and large) and two types of minivans (mid-size and large). The resources required and the profit contributions yielded by each  type  of  vehicle  are shown  in Table below.  At present, 6500 tons of steel and 65,000 hours of labor are  available. If any vehicles of a given type are produced, production of that type of vehicle is economically feasible only if at least a minimal number of that type are produced. These minimal numbers are also listed in Table below. Dorian wants to find a production schedule that maximizes its profit.
